## Introduction

The Snake Game is a classic game where the player maneuvers a line (the snake) which grows in length as it consumes points on the screen. The game ends when the snake runs into the screen border or into itself.

This version of the Snake Game is implemented using React.js. It features a grid-based game area, score tracking, and adjustable game speed.

## Installation

To install and run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the game by running `npm start`.

## Usage

The game starts immediately upon loading the page. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. The game speed can be adjusted using the ‘+’ and ‘-’ buttons on the game screen. The current and best scores are displayed above the game area.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the game are welcome. Please ensure that your code follows the existing style for consistency.

Enjoy the game!
